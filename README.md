# information_retrieval_for_fetch_rewards_app
Information retrieval system that given a name of brand,  retailer or product category/parent category returns the offers that are relevant to the search query.


Fetch Rewards is a mobile app where you can earn free gift cards by scanning and uploading your shopping receipts. You accumulate points for eligible receipts, which can be redeemed for various gift cards. It's a way to get rewards for your everyday shopping.
Fetch provides value to their user base through the rich variety of offers that are active in the app. They want their users to be able to easily seek out offers in the app, so that they get the most out of using the app and their partners get the most out of their relationship with Fetch.

Solution
Here is a tool that allows users to intelligently search for offers via text input from the user.

How it works ? 
If a user searches for a brand (ex.Huggies) the tool returns a list of offers that are relevant to that brand, similarly, if user searches for retailer .i.e. Target, it
will return relevant offers.

Final deployed app is available at Hugging Face spaces : https://huggingface.co/spaces/rishikesh/search_offers
